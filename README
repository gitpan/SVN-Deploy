SVN-Deploy version 0.1
=======================

SVN::Deploy implements an interface to handle release data held within
a separate SVN repository. You can define categorized products where
each product consists of multiple sources (SVN repositories and
directories or files from a filesystem) and multiple destinations
(filesystem directories).

It was designed for situations where the build and deploy steps should
not be performed by the developers of a product but by operators with
only read access to the developers repository, while the developers
have no access to the deploy repository.

The overall outline looks like this:

  (dev:developers, op:operating, usr:users/testers):

    - (dev) define a product
            (location of sources from the devel repo and/or files,
            providing build procedures, etc)
    - (op)  define the product in the deploy repository
    - (dev) order a new release (give source revision numbers to op)
    - (op)  build the release
            (resulting in a new revision in the deploy repo)
    - (op)  deploy the new release to QA environment giving
            release revision info to testers
    - (usr) approve/reject the release
    - (op)  on approval deploy the new release to
            production environment

All information and the build/deploy history is held in the deploy
repository and can be easily exported for auditing purposes.

The deploy repository will look like this:

    repo_root
      \-- Category1
      \-- Category2
        \-- Product1
          \-- 0
            \-- subdir1
              \-- file1
              \-- file2
            \--file1
        \-- Product2
          \-- 0
          \-- 1
          \-- 2
      ...
